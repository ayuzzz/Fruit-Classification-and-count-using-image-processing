# Fruit-Classification-and-count-using-image-processing
The proposed system uses image processing along with deep machine learning for classification of fruits. It calculates fruit count as well.
-> The system uses multi-class SVM "Crammer Singer"

The current limitations include :
- Counting of overlapping fruits
- Limited to 5 types of fruits
